Introducing "Meal Timer," an Android app that makes choosing meals easier every day. The app, which was inspired by Hera's hectic schedule, makes easy breakfast, lunch, and dinner suggestions so you can make a quick meal choice even on chaotic days. Your meals will be as enjoyable as they are quick to select thanks to the interface's practicality and easy of use.
